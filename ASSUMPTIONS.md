# Assumptions

- We are allowed to use 3rd party fonts.
- We use the terminology artist-albums page, album-songs page and list of artists page
  instead of the one given in instruction to avoid confusion.
- We have a few extra artists featured that don't have atleast 5 albums. Some of these ablums don't have 5 songs either. However, we have made sure to feature the first 5 artists with atleast 5 albums as per requirement, and each of these albums have atleast 5 songs.
- To do the scaling animation, we can use CSS.
- In the requirement "Use radio buttons for review input", you can use stars are radio buttons.
For this we have taken reference from [here](https://scottaohara.github.io/a11y_styled_form_controls/src/radio-button--rating/).
